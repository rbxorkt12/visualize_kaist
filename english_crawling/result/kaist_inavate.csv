"                                            Researchers at The Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), say the ultracompact camera captures high-contrast and high-resolution images and was based on the eye structures of paper wasp species Xenos peckii. Led by Professor Ki-Hun Jeong, the team says the camera is packaged with micro-optical elements such as inverted micro-lenses, multilayerd pinhole arrays and gap spacers on the image sensor. It has a total track length of 740 μm and a field of view of 73-degrees.According to reports from the research university, the camera has successfully demonstrated high-contrast clear array images acquired from tiny micro lenses. The team say they further enhanced the image quality of the captured image by combining the arrayed images into one image through super-resolution imaging., Professor Jeong said: “This research has led to technological advances in imaging technology. We will continue to strive to make significant impacts on multidisciplinary research projects in the fields of microtechnology and nanotechnology, seeking inspiration from natural photonic structures.”                                                ",KAIST team develops tiny camera inspired by insect eyes,https://www.inavateonthenet.net/news/article/kaist-team-develops-tiny-camera-inspired-by-insect-eyes
"                                            ""Our research will become a core technology in developing light emitting diodes on fibres, which are fundamental elements of fabrics,"" said Professor Choi, head of the research team at the School of Electrical Engineering at KAIST. ""We hope we can lower the barrier of wearable displays entering the market."" To produce the LEDs, the scientists begin with a fiber of polyethylene terephthalate, which is then dipped into a solution of PEDOT:PSS and then left to dry at 130° C for 30 minutes to ready it for layering with organic materials. Once dried, the dipped fibre is then re-dipped in a bath of poly-p-phenylenevinylene polymer organic LED (OLED) solution, dried again in an oven, and finally coated with a Lithium Fluoride/Aluminum (LiF/Al) compound.The researchers say this process is a more efficient way of applying LED materials to small cylindrical structures than any heat-treating method. By carefully adjusting the extraction rate of the fibre from the solution, the researchers say they can control the deposition thickness to within hundreds of thousandths of a nanometer. The researchers believe their method of producing LED fibres could be an accelerator for the commercialisation of wearable displays because inexpensive, automated high-volume production of fibres using such textile manufacturing methods as roll-to-roll processing could be employed. In this way, LED fibres could be mass-produced as easily as nylon or polyethylene fibre is produced today.

"                                            To operate the system the user stands in front of a large display which acts as a transparent screen between the user and their reflection. A depth camera captures the gesture and body shape of the person and designs are projected onto their body.The virtual garments are visible both on the user’s body as well as in the reflection to obtain a third person perspective.  A background projector can also be employed to show various environments so the user can see how their clothes look in places like an office, a forest or a beach.  The users can also design their clothes using mid-air gestures, rotating and scaling patterns and images to their liking. Designs can then be shared, exported and printed onto clothing.Similar systems have been produced and are gaining interest from global clothing firms. Adidas plans to offer technology where shoppers can customise their own designs in stores by 2017.

"                                            Professor Kyung Cheol Choi, from the School of Electrical Engineering at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST), and his team made the breakthrough. They believe that the technology, which produces high-efficiency, long-lasting OLEDs, can be used in wearable displays.The OLED fibres can be woven into textiles and knitted clothes and can withstand tensile strains of up to 4.3% while retaining more than 90% of their efficiency. Fibres can be thinner than a human hair.Professor Choi said: “Existing fiber-based wearable displays had limitations for applicability due to their low performance. However, this technology can fabricate OLEDs with high performance on fibers. This simple, low-cost process opens a way to commercialize fiber-based wearable displays.” This research led by a PhD candidate Seonil Kwon was published online in the international journal for nanoscience, Nano Letters, on December 6.

"                                            Professor Woohun Lee at the Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology however is working towards reintroducing the human element back into digital displays with his TransWall project. TransWall is the result of two years of work with input from the KAIST’s Industrial Design department and Human Computer Interaction lab which is part of the computer department. TransWall is a transparent screen that is housed within a T-shaped frame and incorporates two overhead-mounted projectors that can project images on either side. The screen itself is made from two sheets of plexiglass, with a clear holographic film sandwiched in between. Infra-red touch sensors can be found on either side of the frames and a surface transducer is mounted in the plexiglass along with integrated microphones. According to Professor Woohun, one of the hurdles he had to face was selecting the right materials for the screen. He says: “The first big challenge was that we needed to find a transparent display large enough to support face-to-face interaction. We searched a lot but couldn’t find a great contender. Samsung had a transparent display but it has 40 percent transparency, which is not enough for our purposes. In the end we went with the holographic display we are using right now. It has enough transparency and at the same time the display is clear.”  Users of the TransWall can stand on either side of the display and proceed to use the screen as they would any touch-enable surface. The input from the fingertips is detected by the infra-red sensors, sent to a computer to be processed and displayed on the holographic film via the projectors. The transducer is included to provide vibration feedback to the users. Since the screen is transparent, users can not only see their own work but they can also see the person they are communicating with thanks to the transparent display. There are already some possible applications for TransWall being discussed. Professor Woohun says: “A lot of interest has been shown from the education sector. Face-to-face interaction is very natural for children and kids and they are very familiar with it, which might be one of the reasons for this.” He goes on to further explain the place TransWall might have in the future of education: “We are in talks with a Korean company that provides smart class solutions and systems. They replace traditional whiteboards with touch screens. Now we are in talks to possibly implement TransWall next. Nowadays elementary schools and even kindergarten use the digital medium for education. TransWall can allow users to get that human-feel with social and body interaction while enjoying digital content.” Businesses can also make use of the TransWall technology. Professor Woohun Says: “In the commercial sector advertising companies are interested in our project.” He thinks that TransWall can offer significant advantages in applications where space is at a premium. “In cities like Seoul and Tokyo which are very densely populated, there may not always be space for tradition displays for advertising. This is where TransWall can help.” Work on the next iteration of TransWall has already commenced. Professor Woohun says that they are aiming to make the next model smaller, thinner and lighter. They are also planning to add speakers to the mix as well introduce haptic response for feedback.

"                                            KAIST researchers note that holographic displays “operate by generating carefully tailored light fields that replicate how humans see an actual environment”. Efforts to create displays of this kind have however been stalled by the limited capabilities of wave front modulators. “In particular,” write the researchers, “spatial light modulators have a small diffraction angle range and limited pixel number limiting the viewing angle and image size of a holographic 3D display”. The alternative method controls volume speckle fields to enhance image definition. Researchers also claim a viewing angle of 35 degrees and said that the image was 2,600 times stronger than the original image definition created without the use of a diffuser.
